## Overview


An `ExecutionGraph` tracks the relationships between different [`ExecutionNode`](/execution-node) instances, representing the entire workflow's execution.
The execution graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of nodes, where each node represents an image processing task.
Each layer of the graph represents an operation done by a specific agent.

The creation/utlization of the ExecutionGraph is handled by Overeasy under the hood and is mostly just exposed for convenience, debugging, and visualizations.



### Methods

### ascii_graph

Prints a text-based representation of the graph.

<Underline text="Returns" margin="mt-0" />
<ResponseField name="ascii_graph" type="None">
  Outputs the ASCII representation of the graph to the console.
</ResponseField>

### parent_of

Returns the parent node of a given node. Raises an error if the node has multiple parents.

<Underline text="Arguments" margin="mt-0" />
<ParamField path="node" type="ExecutionNode">
  The node for which to find the parent.
</ParamField>

<UnderlineMargin text="Returns" margin="mt-0" />
<ResponseField name="parent_node" type="ExecutionNode">
  The parent node of the given node.
</ResponseField>



### top_sort

Performs a topological sort of the graph, returning a list of lists of nodes representing each level of the graph.

<UnderlineMargin text="Returns" margin="mt-0" />
<ResponseField name="sorted_nodes" type="List[List[ExecutionNode]]">
  A list of lists of nodes representing each level of the graph.
</ResponseField>
