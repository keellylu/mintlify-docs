## Overview

The utilization of the `ExecutionGraph` is handled by Overeasy under the hood and is exposed to help with debugging and visualization.
{/* 
### Execution Node
An `ExecutionNode` can be represented as follows:

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral' } }%%
flowchart
  subgraph NODE
      IMAGE(IMAGE) ~~~ DATA(DATA)
  end
```

where `DATA` can either be text, a Detection object, or a Pydantic object. 

You can find more details on Execution Nodes [here]().

## Execution Graph */}
An Execution Graph tracks the relationships between different [Execution Node](/types/execution-node) instances, representing the entire workflow's execution. Let's take a look at one step in a workflow: 

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral' } }%%
flowchart TB
    direction TB
    subgraph NODE1
        direction LR
        I1(IMAGE) ~~~ D1(DATA)
    end
    subgraph NODE2
        direction LR
        I2(IMAGE) ~~~ D2(DATA)
    end
    NODE1 --AGENT--> NODE2
```

Upon execution of the agent, Node 2 is added to the Execution Graph, which contains its own image and data attributes.

A workflow is comprised of a series of agents that are executed in order. An Execution Graph takes the form of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where each layer of the graph represents the outcome of a step in the workflow. Here's an example:

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral' } }%%
flowchart TD
  A(NODE) --- SPLIT(AGENT) --> 1(NODE) & 2(NODE) & 3(NODE) & 4(NODE)
  1 --AGENT--> 1.1(NODE)
  2 --AGENT--> 2.1(NODE)
  3 --AGENT--> 3.1(NODE)
  4 --AGENT--> 4.1(NODE) 
  1.1 & 2.1 & 3.1 & 4.1 --- JOIN(AGENT) --> 5(NODE)
  style SPLIT fill:#ffffff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:0px
  style JOIN fill:#ffffff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:0px
```

   An example output could look like:
   ```

            â”‚           â””â”€â”€ Node(ID=5)
            â””â”€â”€ Node(ID=12)
                â””â”€â”€ Node(ID=13)
                    â””â”€â”€ Node(ID=14)
                        â””â”€â”€ Node(ID=5)
  ```

  An analysis:

  -- **Node(ID=0)**: This is the root node from which all operations begin.

  -- **Node(ID=1)**: This node is directly connected to the root node and acts as a branching point for multiple parallel paths.

  -- **Node(ID=2), Node(ID=6), Node(ID=9), Node(ID=12)**: These nodes are the starting points of separate branches that start from Node(ID=1). Each branch processes data independently.

  -- **Node(ID=3, 7, 10, 13) and Node(ID=4, 8, 11, 14)**: These nodes represent subsequent steps in each respective branch, processing data sequentially within their branch.

  -- **Node(ID=5)**: This node is a convergence point where all branches merge.
