## Overview

Workflows allow you to sequentially chain agents together to process images. They provide a framework for executing and visualizing a sequence of image processing steps.

## Arguments
<ParamField path="steps" type="List[Agent]" required>
  An **immutable** list of agents to serially execute
</ParamField>


## Example

```python
workflow = Workflow([
    BoundingBoxSelectAgent(classes=["face"]),
    SplitAgent(),
    ClassificationAgent(classes=["glasses", "no glasses"]),
    JoinAgent()
])
```



## Methods

<ParamField path="Workflow.execute(input_image)">
  
  Executes the workflow on the given input image and returns the final results and the execution graph.

  **Arguments:** 
  - `input_image` (`PIL.Image.Image`): The input image to be processed by the workflow.
  
  **Returns:**
  - `result, graph` (`Tuple[List[ExecutionNode], ExecutionGraph]`): A tuple containing the final execution nodes and the execution graph.

</ParamField>


<ParamField path="Workflow.visualize(graph)">
  Visualizes the workflow using the Gradio library, displaying each agent's inputs and outputs in a structured format.

  **Arguments:** 
  - `graph` (`ExecutionGraph`): The execution graph of the workflow.
  
  **Returns:**
  - Spawns a Gradio instance that runs until it is closed.
</ParamField>

## Example Usage

```python
from PIL import Image
input_image = Image.open("path/to/image.jpg")

# Create a workflow
workflow = Workflow(steps=[
    BoundingBoxSelectAgent(classes=["person"]),
    DenseCaptioningAgent(),
    ClassificationAgent(classes=["cat", "dog"])
])

# Execute the workflow on the image
output_nodes, graph = workflow.execute(input_image)

# Visualize the workflow
workflow.visualize(graph)
``` */}
