## Overview

The `Workflow` class provides a framework for executing and visualizing a sequence of image processing steps using various agents.
Workflows allow you to sequentially chain agents together to process images.

## Params
<ParamField path="steps" type="List[Agent]">
  A **immutable** list of agents to serially execute
</ParamField>


## Example

```
workflow = Workflow([
    BoundingBoxSelectAgent(classes=["face"]),
    SplitAgent(),
    ClassificationAgent(classes=["glasses", "no glasses"])
])
```



## Methods

### Workflow.execute 
Executes the workflow on the given input image and returns the final results and the execution graph.

<Underline text="Arguments" margin="mt-0" />

<ParamField path="input_image" type="PIL.Image.Image">
  The input image to be processed by the workflow.
</ParamField>

<UnderlineMargin text="Returns" margin="mt-0" />
<ResponseField name="result, graph" type="Tuple[List[ExecutionNode], ExecutionGraph]">
  A tuple containing the final execution nodes and the execution graph.
</ResponseField>


### Workflow.visualize

Visualizes the workflow using the Gradio library, displaying each agent's inputs and outputs in a structured format.

<Underline text="Arguments" margin="mt-0" />

<ParamField path="graph" type="ExecutionGraph">
  An `ExecutionGraph` instance representing the execution graph of the workflow.
</ParamField>

<UnderlineMargin text="Returns" margin="mt-0" />
  Spawns a gradio instance that runs until it is closed.



## Example Usage

```python
from PIL import Image
input_image = Image.open("path/to/image.jpg")

# Create a workflow
workflow = Workflow(steps=[
    BoundingBoxSelectAgent(classes=["person"]),
    DenseCaptioningAgent(),
    ClassificationAgent(classes=["cat", "dog"])
])

# Execute the workflow on the image
output_nodes, graph = workflow.execute(input_image)

# Visualize the workflow
workflow.visualize(graph)
```
