The `SplitAgent` is initialized with no arguments: 

```
SplitAgent()
```

### Overview

The `SplitAgent` is often used in conjunction with the `JoinAgent`, and should be invoked right after the `BoundingBoxSelectAgent` in a Workflow. The `SplitAgent` crops images based on the detected bounding boxes.

This Agent segments an image based on bounding box detections, which allows for a focused analysis on specific crops of an input image. Focusing on a specific region of an image can enhance the accuracy of the model by reducing background noise. This localized approach can improve the performance of machine learning models by providing them with more relevant data.

Let's take a look at Example 1's Workflow:

```python example_1.py
workflow = Workflow([
    BoundingBoxSelectAgent(classes=["person"]),
    SplitAgent(),
    InstructorImageAgent(response_model=PPE),
    ToClassificationAgent(fn=lambda x: "has ppe" if x.hardhat else "no ppe"),
    JoinAgent(),
])
```
