The `JoinAgent` is initialized with no arguments: 

```
JoinAgent()
```

### Overview

The `JoinAgent` is used in conjunction with the `SplitAgent`. It merges multiple crops of an image to consolidate results.

Let's take a look at Example 1's Workflow:

```python example_1.py
workflow = Workflow([
    BoundingBoxSelectAgent(classes=["person"]),
    SplitAgent(),
    InstructorImageAgent(response_model=PPE),
    ToClassificationAgent(fn=lambda x: "has ppe" if x.hardhat else "no ppe"),
    JoinAgent(),
])
```

In this Workflow, the JoinAgent merges the results from individual processing back into a single output. After each detected person in the image has been individually asscessed for PPE by the `InstructorImageAgent` and classified by the `ToClassificationAgent`, the `JoinAgent` reassembles individual results into a unified format.

This gathers a comprehensive output that reflects the PPE status of all detected persons in the original image.
