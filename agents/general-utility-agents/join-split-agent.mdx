title: 'Join and Split Agents'
---

The `SplitAgent` and the `JoinAgent` are both initialized with no arguments: 

```
SplitAgent()
JoinAgent()
```

### Overview

The `SplitAgent` is used in conjunction with the `JoinAgent`. The `SplitAgent` creates multiple crops of an image, and the `JoinAgent` consolidates the results.

Let's take a look at Example 1's Workflow:

```python example_1.py
workflow = Workflow([
    BoundingBoxSelectAgent(classes=["person"]),
    SplitAgent(),
    InstructorImageAgent(response_model=PPE),
    ToClassificationAgent(fn=lambda x: "has ppe" if x.hardhat else "no ppe"),
    JoinAgent(),
])
```

### Split Agent

After identifying the bounding boxes around each "person", the `SplitAgent` separates the detected individuals so that subsequent processing can be applied to each person detection individually.

### Join Agent

After each person detection in the image has been individually assessed and classified, the `JoinAgent` reassembles the individual results back into a single output.

This gathers a comprehensive output that reflects the PPE status of all detected persons in the original image.
