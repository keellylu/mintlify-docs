## Properties

### Parameters

The `BoundingBoxSelectAgent` accepts three arguments: 

```
BoundingBoxSelectAgent(classes, split, model(Optional))
```


<ResponseField name="classes" type="List[String]" required>
**Specifies the list of objects to detect within an image for the object detection task.**

Each object of interest (or "class") should be described textually within the `classes` list. 

> Note: Since a text embedding of each class will be used to identify objects, a more specific class name will yield a more specific detection. You should scope your class names accordingly. For instance, a `"car"` class will result in more general detections than a `"blue Honda Accord"` class.
> 
> _Ex. Given an image of a street view, you may be interested in detecting cars, trucks, and pedestrians. In this case, it would make sense to define `classes` as_
`classes = ["car", "truck", "pedestrian"].`


</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="split" type="Boolean" required>
A flag that determines whether the image should be split based on detections.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="model" type="BoundingBoxModel">
Represents the model used to perform the detection task and takes an instance of `BoundingBoxModel`. If left unspecified, this parameter defaults to the `GroundingDINO()` model. 
  
The supported `BoundingBoxModel` models can be found below:

### Example

Here is an example of the `BoundingBoxSelectAgent` as part of a `Workflow` for counting hardhats.

```python example.py
workflow.add_step(BoundingBoxSelectAgent(classes=["construction hat"], model=GroundingDINO(), split=True))
```
