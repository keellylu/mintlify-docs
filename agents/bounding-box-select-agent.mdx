## Initialization

### Parameters

The `BoundingBoxSelectAgent` is initialized with three arguments: 

```
BoundingBoxSelectAgent(classes, split, model(Optional))
```


<ResponseField name="classes" type="List[String]" required>
**Specifies the list of objects to detect within an image for the object detection task.**

Each object of interest (or "class") should be included within the `classes` list. 
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="split" type="Boolean" required>
**A flag that determines whether the image should be split based on detections.**

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="model" type="BoundingBoxModel">
**Represents the model used to perform the detection task. If left unspecified, this parameter defaults to `GroundingDINO()`.**
  
The supported `BoundingBoxModel` models can be found below:
  <Expandable title="Supported MultimodalLLMs">
    <ResponseField name="GroundingDINO()" type="BoundingBoxModel (Default)">
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="DETIC()" type="BoundingBoxModel">
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="OwlV2()" type="BoundingBoxModel">
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="YOLOWorld()" type="BoundingBoxModel">
    </ResponseField>

  </Expandable>

</ResponseField>

> Note: Since a text embedding of each class will be used to identify objects, a more specific class name will yield a more specific detection. You should scope your class names accordingly. 
> 
> For instance, a `"car"` class will yield more general detections than a `"blue Honda Accord"` class.



### Example

Here is an example of the `BoundingBoxSelectAgent` as part of a `Workflow` for counting hardhats.

```python example.py
workflow.add_step(BoundingBoxSelectAgent(classes=["construction hat"], model=GroundingDINO(), split=True))
```
