## Initialization

### Parameters

Tge`InstructorImageAgent` is initialized with two arguments: 

```
InstructorImageAgent(response_model, model(Optional))
```

<ResponseField name="response_model" type="BaseModel" required>
**Specifies the structure of the data that the OpenAI API is expected to return. This structured model helps in parsing and validating the data returned from the API, ensuring it adheres to the expected format.**

This parameter expects a class that is a subclass of `BaseModel` from the `pydantic` library. 
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="model" type="Optional[String]">
**Specifies the model identifier used by the OpenAI API to process the image. The default value is `"gpt-4o"`.**

You can find a comprehensive list of all OpenAI API models [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models).
</ResponseField>

## Execution

### Parameters
The `Workflow` is expected to have some sort of image input that needs to be processed. 

### Example

Here is an example of the `InstructorImageAgent` as part of a `Workflow` for counting vehicles.

**Step 1. Define a `response_model`.**

```python example.py
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List

class ProductFeature(BaseModel):
    feature_name: str
    description: str

class ProductDetails(BaseModel):
    product_name: str
    price: float
    available: bool
    features: List[ProductFeature]
```

This model expects the analysis to return the counts of different types of vehicles and a timestamp indicating the time of the image capture.

**Step 2. Use `InstructorTextAgent`.**

```python example.py
agent = InstructorTextAgent(response_model=ProductDetails)
```

**Step 3. Incorporate the `InstructorTextAgent` into a `Workflow`.**

```python example.py
from overeasy.agents import Workflow, ExecutionNode, ExecutionGraph

# Define a workflow with our detailed text agent
workflow = Workflow(steps=[agent])

# Example text input asking about a product
input_text = "Tell me about the features of the MacBook Pro 2021 model."

# Execute the workflow
result_nodes, execution_graph = workflow.execute(input_text)

# Print the structured response
for node in result_nodes:
    product_details = node.data
    print(f"Product: {product_details.product_name}")
    print(f"Price: ${product_details.price}")
    print(f"Available: {'Yes' if product_details.available else 'No'}")
    for feature in product_details.features:
        print(f"Feature: {feature.feature_name}, Description: {feature.description}")
```
