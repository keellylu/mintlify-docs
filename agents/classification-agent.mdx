## Properties

### Parameters

The `ClassificationAgent` accepts two arguments: 

```
ClassificationAgent(classes, model(Optional))
```


<ResponseField name="classes" type="List[String]" required>
**Specifies the list of class labels that will be used for the image classification task.**

Each object of interest (or "class") should be described textually within the `classes` list. 

> Note: Since a text embedding of each class will be used to when classifying the image, a more specific class name will yield a more specific detection. You should scope your class names accordingly. For instance, a `"car"` class will result in more general detections than a `"blue Honda Accord"` class.
> 
> _Ex. Given an image of a street view, you may be interested in detecting cars, trucks, and pedestrians. In this case, it would make sense to define `classes` as_
`classes = ["car", "truck", "pedestrian"].`


</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="model" type="ClassificationModel">
Represents the model used to perform the image segmentation task and takes an instance of `ClassificationModel`. If left unspecified, this parameter defaults to the `CLIP()` Model. 
  
The supported `ClassificationModel` models can be found below:

### Example

Here is an example of the `ClassificationAgent` as part of a `Workflow` for identifying cracked eggs.

```python example.py
workflow.add_step(ClassificationAgent(classes=["cracked egg", "whole egg", "not egg"]))
```
