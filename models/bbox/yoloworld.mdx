## Overview

YOLO-World is a series of models that extend the YOLO (You Only Look Once) framework to open-world settings, allowing for dynamic object detection across a variety of environments. These models are designed to handle a wide range of object types and are particularly useful for applications requiring robust and real-time object detection.

<ParamField path="YOLOWorld(model: str)">

The `YOLOWorld` class encapsulates the functionality of the YOLO-World models, providing methods for loading the model, detecting objects based on textual descriptions, and managing resources.
</ParamField>


<ParamField path="model" default="yolov8l-worldv2">
 Specifies which version of the model to load the `s` models are less accurate and faster will the `l` models are more accurate but slower.
 
 Valid options include `"yolov8s-worldv2"`, `"yolov8m-worldv2"`, `"yolov8l-worldv2"`, `"yolov8s-world"`, `"yolov8m-world"`, and `"yolov8l-world"`.
</ParamField>

## Methods

<ParamField path="YOLOWorld.detect(image, classes)">
- `detect(image: Union[np.ndarray, Image.Image], classes: List[str])-> Detections`: 

This method detects objects in the provided `image` based on the `classes` described in text. 
 Returns a BoundingBox [`Detections`](/types/detections) object.
</ParamField>

## When to use?

YOLO-World models are the fastest among the available models and the only ones capable of performing real-time detection, making them ideal for scenarios where speed is critical, such as in video surveillance or autonomous driving. 
They provide a good balance between speed and accuracy but may struggle with labels that are not similar to the standard COCO labels.

## Example Usage

```bash
wget -O kites.jpg "https://github.com/overeasy-sh/overeasy/blob/main/examples/kites.jpg?raw=true"
```

```python
from overeasy import *
from PIL import Image
workflow = Workflow([
BoundingBoxSelectAgent(classes=["butterfly kite"], model=YOLOWorld()),
])

image = Image.open("./kites.jpg")
results, graph = workflow.execute(image)
workflow.visualize(graph)
```

<Frame caption="Note how the model did not filter out the butterfly kite, but instead just selected all the kites">
