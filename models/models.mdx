## Overview
### Bounding Box Detection Models

Overeasy supports a variety of models that specialize in bounding box object detection.
In Overeasy's case these Bounding Box models are (Open Vocabulary Detection Models)[https://paperswithcode.com/task/open-vocabulary-object-detection], which means they draw bounding boxes based on their semantic understanding of the labels.
This allows you to create very powerful zero shot detection workflows

### Embedding Models
Overeasy includes embeddings models such as `CLIP`, these can used for tasks like Classification and Retrieval.

### OCR Models
Overeasy includes dedicated Optical Character Recognition models like `AWS Textract`, these can be used for tasks like Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and text extraction from images.

### Multimodal LLMs
A multimodal LLM capable of handling both text and visual inputs, useful for tasks that require understanding and generating content based on combined input types.

### LLMs
Standard LLMs that can handle text inputs only, are still useful in many Overeasy workflows.
