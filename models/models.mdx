## Overview
### Bounding Box Detection Models

Overeasy supports a variety of models that specialize in bounding box object detection.
In Overeasy's case these Bounding Box models are [Open Vocabulary Detection Models](https://paperswithcode.com/task/open-vocabulary-object-detection), which means they draw bounding boxes based on their semantic understanding of the labels.
This allows you to create very powerful zero shot detection workflows.

### Embedding Models
Overeasy supports embeddings models such as `CLIP`, which can be used for tasks like Classification and Retrieval.

### OCR Models
Overeasy supports dedicated Optical Character Recognition models like `AWS Textract`, which can be used for tasks like Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and text extraction from images.

### Multimodal LLMs
Overeasy supports multimodal LLM capable of handling both text and visual inputs, which are useful for tasks that require understanding and generating content based on combined input types.

### LLMs
Overeasy supports standard LLMs that can handle text inputs only, which are still useful in many Overeasy workflows.
