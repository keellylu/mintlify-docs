### **Step 1.** Set up virtual environment (Optional):
We recommend setting up Overeasy with a virtual environment.

If you don't already have conda installed you can install it [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/).

``` 
conda create -n overeasy python=3.10
conda activate overeasy
```


### **Step 2.** Install Overeasy:
<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should be using Python version ```>=3.10```.
</Info>
<CodeGroup>

```bash pip3
pip3 install overeasy
```

</CodeGroup>

### **Step 3.** Setup API Keys:

If you want to use private models like GPT4o, Claude or Gemini, you will need to setup the relevant API keys.

**1. Obtain API Keys.**

If you haven't created these API keys yet, follow the instructions below:

> **`OPENAI_API_KEY`**: Navigate to OpenAI's [API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to obtain your API key.  You can visit their [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) to find more detailed information.


> **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`**: Navigate to the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/login?returnTo=%2F%3F) to get your API key on the [API keys page](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys). You can visit their [documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/getting-access-to-claude) to find more detailed information.


> **`GEMINI_API_KEY`**: Navigate to Gemini's [API keys page](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to obtain your API key. You can visit their [documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) to find more detailed information.

**2. Add API Keys to Environment Variables.**

To use your API keys, you'll need to add them to your environment variables.

> 
> 1. **Open terminal**: Open your Terminal app. You can find it in `Applications` > `Utilities` > `Terminal`.
> 
> 2. **Edit Bash profile**: You can use either **Zsh** or **Bash**.
> 
>      - For **Zsh** (default on newer macOS): Type `nano ~/.zshrc`.
>      - For **Bash**: Type `nano ~/.bash_profile`.
> 
>      You should see a file open.
>
> 3. **Add your API key**: Add the following lines to the end of the opened file:
> 
> ```
> export OPENAI_API_KEY = "your api key"
> export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "your api key"
> export GEMINI_API_KEY = "your api key"
> ```
> 4. **Save and exit**: Save your changes by pressing `Ctrl + O`, then press `Enter`. Exit the file by pressing `Ctrl + X`.
> 
> 5. **Reload profile**: Type `source ~/.zshrc` (for Zsh) or `source ~/.bash profile` (for Bash) to reload the profile.

These steps will ensure your API key is available for use in your environment.

**3. Congrats! You are now ready to start writing Overeasy code ü•≥.**
