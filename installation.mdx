<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up Virtual Environment (Optional)">
    We recommend setting up Overeasy with a virtual environment. 
    If you don't already have conda installed you can install it [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/).
    ```bash
    conda create -n overeasy python=3.10
    conda activate overeasy
    ```
  </Step>


  <Step title="Install Overeasy">
    <Info>
      You should be using a Python version ```>=3.10```.
    </Info>
    Install Overeasy using the following command:
    ```bash
    pip3 install overeasy
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Setup API Keys">
      If you want to use private models like *GPT-4o*, *Claude* or *Gemini*, you will need to setup the relevant API keys.
      {/* If you haven't created these API keys yet, follow the instructions below: */}

      > **`OPENAI_API_KEY`**: Navigate to OpenAI's [API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to obtain your API key.  You can visit their [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) to find more detailed information.

      > **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`**: Navigate to the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/login?returnTo=%2F%3F) to get your API key on the [API keys page](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys). You can visit their [documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/getting-access-to-claude) to find more detailed information.

      > **`GEMINI_API_KEY`**: Navigate to Gemini's [API keys page](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to obtain your API key. You can visit their [documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) to find more detailed information.

      **Setting Up API Keys in Environment Variables**

      <Tabs>
        <Tab title="Mac/Linux">
          At the end of your `~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` add the following:
          ```bash
          export OPENAI_API_KEY="your api key"
          export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your api key"
          export GEMINI_API_KEY="your api key"
          ```
          Make sure to open a new terminal or `source` your profile so these changes take effect.
        </Tab>
        <Tab title="Windows">
          Open PowerShell and run the following:
          ```powershell
          setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your api key"
          setx ANTHROPIC_API_KEY "your api key"
          setx GEMINI_API_KEY "your api key"
          ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab title="Python">
          **Hardcoding API keys**


          You can also manually set these environment variables in python.
          ```python python
          import os
          os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your api key"
          os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "your api key"
          os.environ["GEMINI_API_KEY"] = "your api key"
          ```

          **Loading from .env**


          Or load them from a `.env` file.

          ```bash 
          pip3 install python-dotenv
          ```

          Create a `.env` file in your project root and add the following:
          ```bash .env
          OPENAI_API_KEY="your api key"
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your api key"
          GEMINI_API_KEY="your api key"
          ```

          ```python python
          from dotenv import load_dotenv
          load_dotenv()
          ```
        </Tab>
