Here's the image we'll be working with:

We will present 3 different approaches to this problem, each highlighting different way to construct Overeasy Workflows.

## Example 1

This approach uses the `InstructorImageAgent` to check for PPE, and uses a custom `PPE` BaseModel.

## Example 2

This approach detects each worker's head, and uses the `ClassificationAgent` to check for PPE.

## Example 3
 
 This approach uses the `DenseCaptioningAgent` to generate a text description of each person. These descriptions inform the classification task.
