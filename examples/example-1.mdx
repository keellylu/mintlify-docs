## Approach

This approach uses the `InstructorImageAgent` to check for PPE, and uses a custom `PPE` BaseModel.

### **Step 1. Import Overeasy Agents**

First, you need to import the necessary components from the Overeasy library, including the Workflow class and any Agents you plan to use. 

```python example_1.py
from overeasy import Workflow, BoundingBoxSelectAgent, ToClassificationAgent, JoinAgent, SplitAgent, InstructorImageAgent, ClassMapAgent
```

### **Step 2. Load the Image**

Load the image you want to process. The code below constructs a path to an image named `"construction.jpg"` located in the same directory. It loads this image using Pillow.

```python example_1.py
from PIL import Image

image = Image.open("./examples/construction_workers.jpg")
```

### **Step 3. Initialize Workflow**

Instantiate the `Workflow` class with a list of Overeasy Agents, where the order in the list defines the sequence of operations.

For this particular example, we'll need to define a Pydantic `BaseModel` that will be passed into the `InstructorImageAgent`.
```python example_1.py
class PPE(BaseModel):
    hardhat: bool
    vest: bool
    boots: bool
```

This class will be used to represent personal protective equipment (PPE) with three boolean attributes: `hardhat`, `vest`, and `boots`. Each attribute in this class indicates whether the respective item of PPE is present (True) or not (False).

```python example_1.py
workflow = Workflow([
    BoundingBoxSelectAgent(classes=["person"]),
    SplitAgent(),
    InstructorImageAgent(response_model=PPE),
    ToClassificationAgent(fn=lambda x: "has ppe" if x.hardhat else "no ppe"),
    JoinAgent()
])
```

> Let's break down the Agents in this Workflow.
> 
> 1. **`BoundingBoxSelectAgent`:** This Agent is used to detect and select bounding boxes around objects in the image that are classified as "person".
> 
> 2. **`SplitAgent`:** This Agent splits the input into multiple parts based on bounding boxes identified in the previous step. Each split now represents an individual person detected in the image.
> 
> 3. **`InstructorImageAgent`:** For each person detected, this Agent determines whether they are wearing specific personal protective equipment (PPE) such as a hardhat, vest, and boots. The predictions are structured according to the PPE model, which includes boolean fields for hardhat, vest, and boots.
> 
> 4. **`ToClassificationAgent`:** This Agent takes the output from the InstructorImageAgent and further classifies it into two conditions: "has ppe", and "no ppe". This step simplifies the output to whether the person has PPE based on the presence of a hardhat. 
> 
> 5. **`JoinAgent`:** This Agent aggregates results from previous steps into a single output.

### **Step 4. Execute the Workflow**

Call the `execute` method of your Workflow with an initial image. This will process the image through all the Agents.

```python workflow.py
result, graph = workflow.execute(image)
```

### **Step 5. Visualize Results**

Finally, visualize the results to see the classification and detection outputs. Use the `visualize` method to view a graphical representation of the Workflow execution, including intermediate images and data at each step.

```python workflow.py
workflow.visualize(graph)
```

Here's what the Gradio output should look like:
