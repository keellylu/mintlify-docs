## What is Overeasy?

Overeasy is a framework designed for constructing multi-step visual workflows. We're here to make computer vision tasks simple by breaking down complicated workflows into manageable, sequential operations.

## Getting Started

Overeasy is designed around 2 components: `Workflows` and `Agents`. 

> An `Agent` performs a specific image processing task.
>
> A `Workflow` defines a sequence of Agents that are executed **in order** to process an input image. The output of each Agent is passed as an input to the next Agent within a Workflow.
>
> Our Documentation explains each of these components in further detail.
