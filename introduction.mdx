## What is Overeasy?

Overeasy is a framework designed for constructing multi-step visual workflows. We're here to make computer vision tasks simple by breaking down complicated "workflows" into manageable, sequential operations.

## Getting Started

Overeasy is designed around 2 components: `Workflows` and `Agents`. 

> A `Agent` performs a specific image processing task.
>
> A `Workflow` defines a sequence of `Agents` that are executed **in order** to process an input image. The output of each `Agent` is passed as an input to the next `Agent` within a `Workflow`.
>
> Our Documentation explains each of these components in further detail.
