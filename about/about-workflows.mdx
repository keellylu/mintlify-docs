### Initialization

`workflow = Workflow(steps=[Agent1, Agent2, Agent3])`

A Workflow is initialized with a list of Agents, where each Agent is responsible for a specific type of processing or analysis. `Agent1`, `Agent2`, and `Agent3` represent Overeasy Agents, and are executed sequentially in the Workflow.


### Execution

`res, graph = workflow.execute(Image)`

The Workflow execution starts with an input image. It processes the image sequentially through Agents that are listed out in steps. Depending on the Agent type, the image or data from the previous step is transformed or analyzed, and the results are passed to the next Agent.

> Note: `JoinAgent` and `SplitAgent` are special Agents that handle **branching** and **merging** in the data flow, allowing for complex processing pipelines that might involve conditional processing, parallel processing, or aggregations.


### Error Handling

The Workflow includes checks to ensure that the input data is valid and that each Agent receives data in the correct format. Errors are raised if there are mismatches in expected data types or if required data is missing.

### Visualization

After processing, the Workflow can visualize the entire sequence of operations and their results using a graphical interface powered by Gradio. This visualization helps in understanding the transformations applied at each step and the intermediate outputs.

### Examples
To get acquainted with constructing your own Overeasy Workflows, take a look at a few examples we've provided. These examples will provide practical insights into the setup, execution, and management of Workflows, helping you to understand how to integrate different Agents effectively.
